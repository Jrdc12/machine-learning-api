Hello there!

My name is Julio and this is my attempt for the Junior Machine Learning Engineer position assessment.

In-order to use this you must have Python available in your cmd. If you do, then you should clone this project and cd into the root.

once you are in the root directory. run the app.py by typing `python app.py`

and it should start the localhost.

once it starts, open postman or thunderclient and make an API request
